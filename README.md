# Week4 Day3:

### Description:
  - In this assignment we used a combination of Okhttp and async to call on an open api for images and data. We used the flickr API to get the data, then we used Glide to display the images within in the Recyclerview. Afterwards, there was a long click function added to pull up a menu which offered the user 2 choices. One to see a thumbnail version of the art and a larger full view of the image.
